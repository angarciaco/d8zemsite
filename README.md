#### Installing Drupal Site d8zemsite.com

  - This code contains all code, so you would need change credentials for connecting to database, just in case.. and restore SQL on database "d8zemsite" created prevously.

Starting:
```sh
$ git clone git@github.com:angarciaco/d8zemsite.git
$ mv d8zemsite d8zemsite.com
```
After that, it's required that you set right credentials for connecting with your database server (MySQL).. so, you need to modify user and password in array variable for database connection in this file:
```sh
$ cd d8zemsite.com
$ git checkout complete
$ cd ../../
$ sudo nano d8zemsite.com/web/sites/default/settings.php
```
On this case, user and password credentials in this file is "root":
```sh
$databases['default']['default'] = array (
  'database' => 'd8zemsite',
  'username' => 'root',
  'password' => 'root',
  'prefix' => '',
  'host' => '127.0.0.1',
  'port' => '3306',
  'namespace' => 'Drupal\\Core\\Database\\Driver\\mysql',
  'driver' => 'mysql',
);
```
Restore the database backup on database d8zemsite, created previously in MySQL:
```sh
$ cd d8zemsite.com/SQL
$ tar -zxvf d8zemsite.sql.tar.gz
$ mysql -u root -p d8zemsite < d8zemsite.sql
$ cd ../../
